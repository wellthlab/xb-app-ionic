      <br />
      You are being invited to take part in the above research study. To help
      you decide whether you would like to take part or not, it is important
      that you understand why the research is being done and what it will
      involve. Please read the information below carefully and ask questions if
      anything is not clear or you would like more information before you decide
      to take part in this research. You may like to discuss it with others, but
      it is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you are happy to
      participate you will be asked to give consent to participating in this
      research.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>What is the research about?</b>
      <br />
      The research is about people’s experiences of taking up to 35 minutes per
      working day to engage in strength or movement practice.
      <br />
      <br />
      We hope to understand more about the effects, and how to facilitate,
      movement during work; as well as collect evidence to help employers
      evaluate whether such schemes should be offered to their employees.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Why have I been asked to participate?</b>
      <br />
      You have been asked to participate because you are a member of staff at
      the University of Southampton, employed in a participating faculty or
      service, and are at least 18 years old.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you do not meet those criteria, you should not participate in this
      study.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>What will happen to me if I take part?</b>
      <br />
      During the experiment, you will be asked to install an app on your
      smartphone and to spend up to 35 minutes per working day engaging in tasks
      that are suggested by the app. Tasks range from simple “movement snacks”
      (short movements that take only a minute or so) to longer movement
      activities (such as walking or running for a period of time), and tasks
      which will help you to learn more about strength and movement.
      <br />
      <br />
      During the study, you will be asked to log the time that you spend on the
      tasks, as well as answering other questions about your movement and
      general wellbeing. We will not collect data specifically about your
      health, but we will ask you for some limited data about your physical
      condition – for example, how long you’re able to hold a particular
      position, or how well rested you feel. All of the tasks and the questions
      you’ll be asked are voluntary – so you won’t have to do, or answer,
      anything that you are uncomfortable with.
      <br />
      <br />
      You will be able, if you choose, to join a group with your peers, such
      that you will be able to compare experiences, see one anothers’ total
      progress in terms of movement minutes logged, and support one another.
      <br />
      <br />
      You may, if you choose, join the Study team on Microsoft Teams, where you
      will be able to find more information about the study, take part in
      feedback sessions with the investigators, and talk to other participants.
      If you choose to join the Team, your name will be visible to other
      participants and to the study investigators. We might use things that you
      post in the Team to improve the study app, or to further our understanding
      of the research topic. However, we will not link your activity in the Team
      to your wider participation, and we will not share any identifiable data
      from the Team with anybody who is not either a member of the Team itself
      or one of the investigators.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Are there any benefits in my taking part?</b>
      <br />
      Your participation will help us understand how our experiment-in-a-box
      approach will impact the tuning process on your behavioural patterns. We
      expect that many participants will feel better and develop healthy
      strength and movement practices as a result of taking part in the
      experiments.
      <br />
      <br />
      Participating faculties have agreed that you can take up to 35 minutes
      from your working day to participate in this study, and that your
      participating in tasks suggested by the study should be considered part of
      your work.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Are there any risks involved?</b>
      <br />
      There are no significant risks associated with the current study beyond
      those which you might encounter in your day-to-day life. However, if at
      any point you feel uncomfortable please let the researchers know
      immediately.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>What data will be collected?</b>
      <br />
      We will collect information through the app about the tasks that you take
      part in, as well as some information about you, like your age, job family,
      and the service or faculty that you work in.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Will my participation be confidential?</b>
      <br />
      Information that can be linked to you will be kept strictly confidential,
      but you may choose to share with colleagues that you are taking part. In
      some faculties or services, you may need to tell your line manager that
      you are participating. Data that we collect during the study will NOT be
      shared your line manager; and only anonymous results will be shared in
      publications or with the University.
      <br />
      <br />
      We will create some anonymous datasets, which cannot be linked back to you
      or any specific individual, and will share those datasets as ‘open data’,
      available for anybody to analyse.
      <br />
      <br />
      Only members of the research team and responsible members of the
      University of Southampton may be given access to your personal data.
      Personal data will be used only for research purposes, for monitoring
      purposes, and/or to carry out an audit of the study to ensure that the
      research is complying with applicable regulations. Individuals from
      regulatory authorities (people who check that we are carrying out the
      study correctly) may require access to your data. All of these people have
      a duty to keep your information, as a research participant, strictly
      confidential.
      <br />
      <br />
      As far as possible, your data will be kept secure. We will not publish any
      datasets or findings that could be linked back to you, or which disclose
      your identity or personal involvement in the study.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Do I have to take part?</b>
      <br />
      No, it is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you
      decide you want to take part, you will need to sign a consent form to show
      you have agreed to take part.
      <br />
      <br />
      Your faculty or service, manager or colleagues cannot insist that you take
      part in this study; and you should not feel that you have to take part.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>What happens if I change my mind?</b>
      <br />
      You have the right to change your mind and withdraw at any time without
      giving a reason and without your participant rights being affected.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>What will happen to the results of the research?</b>
      <br />
      Your personal details will remain strictly confidential. Research findings
      made available in any reports or publications will not include information
      that can directly identify you without your specific consent.
      <br />
      <br />
      The results of the study will be used in writing up a research paper, may
      be included in publications, and may also be used to inform related
      studies.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Where can I get more information?</b>
      <br />

      <br />
      For the purposes of data protection law, the University of Southampton is

      <br />
      To safeguard your rights, we will use the minimum personal data necessary
      to achieve our research study objectives. Your data protection rights –
      such as to access, change, or transfer such information - may be limited,
