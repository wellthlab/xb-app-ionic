      <b>Study Title:</b> Experiments-In-A-Box (XB): A Technical Model For
      Cultivating Personal Health Heuristics
      <br></br>

      <br></br>
      <br></br>You are being invited to take part in the above research study.
      To help you decide whether you would like to take part or not, it is
      important that you understand why the research is being done and what it
      will involve. Please read the information below carefully and ask
      questions if anything is not clear or you would like more information
      before you decide to take part in this research. You may like to discuss
      it with others, but it is up to you to decide whether or not to take part.
      If you are happy to participate you will be asked to give consent to
      participating in this research.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>What is the research about?</b>
      <br></br>The research is about the impact of simple exercise and factors
      such as daylight on people’s wellbeing, by helping them to undertake
      “personal experiments” into how they feel. More specifically, the current
      project aims to facilitate our understanding of how people can be helped
      to go through “self-tuning” experiments to alter aspects of their
      behaviour. We hope to understand whether these self-experiments are a
      viable way to improve people’s health and wellbeing.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Why have I been asked to participate?</b>
      <br></br>You have been asked to participate because you are part of our
      community here at the University of Southampton.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>What will happen to me if I take part?</b>
      <br></br>During the experiment, you will be asked to install an app on
      your smartphone and to take part in short daily tasks - like walking for a
      certain number of minutes - over a period of several weeks. You will be
      prompted to complete a daily questionnaire about your wellbeing and
      encouraged to notice any changes in your behavioural patterns.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>You will be able, if you choose, to run these experiments in
      groups with your peers, such that you will be able to compare experiences
      and support one another.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Are there any benefits in my taking part?</b>
      <br></br>Your participation will help us understand how our
      experiment-in-a-box approach will impact the tuning process on your
      behavioural patterns. We expect that many participants will feel better as
      a result of taking part in the experiments.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Are there any risks involved?</b>
      <br></br>There are no significant risks associated with the current study
      beyond those which you might encounter in your day-to-day life. However,
      if at any point you feel uncomfortable please let the researchers know
      immediately.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>What data will be collected?</b>
      <br></br>We will collect daily questionnaires about your experience and
      everyday mood, as well as some information about you, like your
      age/profession.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Will my participation be confidential?</b>
      <br></br>Your participation and information that can be linked to you will
      be kept strictly confidential. We will create some anonymous datasets,
      which cannot be linked back to you or any specific individual and will
      share those datasets as ‘open data’, available for anybody to analyse.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>Only members of the research team and responsible members of the
      University of Southampton may be given access to your personal data.
      Personal data will be used only for research purposes, for monitoring
      purposes, and/or to carry out an audit of the study to ensure that the
      research is complying with applicable regulations. Individuals from
      regulatory authorities (people who check that we are carrying out the
      study correctly) may require access to your data. All of these people have
      a duty to keep your information, as a research participant, strictly
      confidential.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>As far as possible, your data will be kept secure. We will not
      publish any datasets or findings that could be linked back to you, or
      which disclose your identity or personal involvement in the study.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Do I have to take part?</b>
      <br></br>No, it is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to take
      part. If you decide you want to take part, you will need to sign a consent
      form to show you have agreed to take part. If you wish to take part in the
      study, you will have to contact the investigators by email at
      gcm1u16@soton.ac.uk
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>What happens if I change my mind?</b>
      <br></br>If you change your mind during the experiment you are free to
      withdraw at any time.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>What will happen to the results of the research?</b>
      <br></br>Your personal details will remain strictly confidential. Research
      findings made available in any reports or publications will not include
      information that can directly identify you without your specific consent.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>The results of the study will be used in writing up a research
      paper, may be included in publications, and may also be used to inform
      related studies.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Where can I get more information?</b>
      <br></br>If you have any further questions regarding the study, please

      <br></br>
      <b>What happens if there is a problem?</b>
      <br></br>If you have a concern about any aspect of this study, you should
      speak to the researchers who will do their best to answer your questions.
      <br></br>If you remain unhappy or have a complaint about any aspect of
      this study, please contact the University of Southampton Research

      of Southampton is required by law to disclose it.
      <br></br>Data protection law requires us to have a valid legal reason
